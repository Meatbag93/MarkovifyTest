1.5.4
Updates readme with the new content.
Adds speakers. These are not very high quality, but they basically allow you to position a soundtrack in the left channel, and the right channel, to simulate speakers. The left speaker will be panned all the way to the left to demonstrate the left channel, and the right speaker will be panned all the way to the right to demonstrate the right channel, so if you encounter a speaker it may sound a little weird, like it's off to your left or right. 
It's always good to try and have the speaker's channel on the same y value as the other channel. I tried placing the right channel a few tiles in front of the left channel, and they sort of echoed off each other.
Fixed a bug in the dialog builder that would still cause the builder to pull up the dialog entry screen, even though you hit Escape before reaching it.
1.5.3 patch (1.5.3.1)
Sound Updater fixes.
1.5.3
Adds dialogs. These are elements that you can put on your map to tell a story, explain a scene, etc. You do not need to put several separate dialogs for a user to hit them one after another. Simply separate each line with two dashes, like so.
Hi -- This is a test -- Thank you, goodbye.
Alternatively, the builder menu has a very intuitive dialog builder you can use that will allow you to press Enter to insert a new line and keep on writing. Once you are satisfied, the next time it asks you to enter something, simply hit Enter or Escape.
1.5.2
Adds history to text input. Use Page up and Page down to select a message or entry you have inputted before, then press Enter. Useful for resending an old PM or old message.
Adds instrument handlers, which will be able to let users play instruments using their keyboard. Will be introduced later in more detail, but they are ready to go once sound update 4.0 rolls out.
Quotes now have a space at the beginning and end so you don't have to manually add a space.
Changes host address.
Host address is no longer announced on the login screen.
1.5.1
Adds a quote feature. If you press Shift plus Q (must be in chats buffer) on a chat, it will automatically input it for you into a chat entry where you can then type your response.
Adds 2D biking and boating support, please use Alt plus arrows to configure facing.
Adds being able to turn while sitting again, I forgot that it completely limits the use of transportation.
Hopefully fixes issues with being unable to press Shift Tab to scroll backward in your inventory.
Text input enhancements: Adds Control Enter for new lines, and carriage returns and line feeds are now spoken when using Left / Right arrows.
Now if a buffer is muted, the message from that buffer will no longer be outputted to all.
Adds a menu to the really exit dialog called other options. So far buffer exporting is the only option in here, but there are plans for more.
1.5 patch (1.5.0.1)
This update patches three bugs.
1. A bug in which you can't press Shift Enter to use items.
2. A bug in which gates would not be destroyed, either while changing maps or leaving the game.
3. A bug in which you could not give people items on 2D maps.

1.5
Improved SAPI support for those using Wine on Linux.
Now if you press Alt F4, you will leave the server rather than losing connection.
You can now toggle between hearing the map loading sound or progress beeps when a map is loading.
Adds a pitch parameter to sounds, just put it right after the volume. Also included in the builder.
During the map loading process, you can now press Space to identify the loading percentage, this is useful for big maps.
Adds gates, these are doors which have length, width and height parameters.
URL's now load after the map is finished loading, this speeds up loading time.
Adds the ability to enter sounds manually when trying to add sources, ambiences, music and doors.
The 3D spyer has been implemented.
You can no longer turn while sitting down.
1.4.1
This update is mostly focused on improving existing features suggested by players, like the buffer system, builder menu and movement, rather than introducing new ones. Therefore the 3D spyer is not included in this version.
You can now press Shift plus Left or Right bracket to jump to the top or bottom buffer.
Fixed a spyer bug with hazards displaying incorrect values.
You can now disable the spyer,  use the builder menu or type nospyer.
This is a very experimental feature, but if you type random_number(minimum_range,maximum_range) as one of the parameters of a platform, sound source, etc, it will generate something within those random parameters. For example, random_number(1,50) would choose a random number between 1 and 50 for that parameter.
You can no longer jump if the max z of your map is set to 0.
Adds auto walking, press A. When auto walking is on it will function like it has always functioned, in which you hold down the arrow keys with the control key to move at a certain speed. When auto walking is disabled, you need to press the arrows to walk, however you are in control of how fast your character goes. This is useful for maps where you need to make exact pinpoint jumps.
1.4
Adds a spyer for 2D maps, as well as the ability to face in certain directions. For the spyer use Shift plus the arrows, and for facing use Alt plus the arrows. Support for biking and boating coming soon.
The game will no longer generate an empty changelog if you don't have a sounds.dat file.
Now if you press Control plus F1, you can use admintell without needing to type /admintell.
The sound changelog is now generated as the dialog is received  and not after it is dismissed.
Adds more information to the readme regarding the 2D features, as well as newer building elements.
You can now add text squares to your map. These are basically signs that make no sound, just speak the text.
1.3
Adds keyhook for JAWS users.
Now if there are sounds that need to be downloaded, if the game detects that the new sounds file is missing, it will now download the full pack. This is useful for packs in which sounds are removed, etc.
Adds a license and credits file as part of the client folder for future use of sounds, attribution, etc. Right now the current sounds are either attributed or links are given to their pages if they haven't provided specific attribution information, as well as the licenses which cover those sonds.
1.2
Adds timed sources. These are basically sources in which you can let them play at specific intervals, rather than looping. For example, if you wanted to play a cat sound every 30 seconds.
Buffer mutes should now save on exit.
Fixed disconnections still going to the connections buffer.
Pressing Alt F4 in the game will now save settings before exitting.
1.1
This update makes some big changes that should hopefully reduce spam and client lag for new players, as well as boost existing server commands with alternative keyboard shortcuts.
Now if you have a buffer muted, the message will still arrive, but it will not be spoken.
If you press Control H, it is now an alternative to sending /help.
Changes some default settings. Buffer interrupting, keyboard sounds, as well as player beacons, are now disabled by default.
Adds two separate buffers, connections, disconnections.
Buffer sounds such as chats, map chats, and private will no longer play sounds when muted. I coded it so that each buffer plays their respective sound independently and not by the server.
1.0
The first public release.
0.9.9
This update attempts to make updating of sounds easier by making the game download the sounds that only need to be updated. Now keep in mind my way of doing this isn't as good, in fact the way I coded this was rather questionable, but it still works and should hopefully speed up the process of sound updating by quite a bit.
0.9.8.2
Adds keyboard themes option in game settings. Requires sound version 2.1.
You can now check your game and sound version from the main menu by pressing V.
0.9.8.1
Reduces the spread of stereo typing a bit so its not ultra stereo. After all, you're not typing on a 30 foot long keyboard.
Fixed a long present bug where the Spacebar sound was not playing.
0.9.8
Adds stereo typing, please go under Game Settings to configure, its disabled by default.
Character repeat and capital announcement input field settings should now save.
New command for pressing F4 in an input field to disable hearing other player's typing.
0.9.7
You can now give items to players, press Alt plus Enter.
0.9.6.1
Fixed the min y and max y showing up twice in the builder menu.
0.9.6
Sounds.dat changelog is now included as part of the sounds.dat and not online, just in case the client is unable to retrieve the new one.
0.9.5.1
If your map is 2D, the min Y and max Y dialogs, as well as any Y prompts, will be removed when using the builder menu, since the Z becomes the y axis. The Z is then converted in the builder menu to look like the y when building.
Readme now defines Golden Crayon as a 2D / 3D game.
Adds rawdata glossary to the readme.
0.9.5
This update adds a very experimental feature. If you put a line in your map that says 2d, your map will convert into a sidescrolling map, with the x and z axis acting as x and y. The only way this can work successfully is if your map has a max y of 0 and a z greater than 0. For example, a map that was 50 by 50 would look something like this.
name test
maxx 50
maxy 0
maxz 50
2d
platform 0 50 0 0 0 0 grass
0.9.4
This update adds online and offline sound volume reduction.
0.9.3
This update is for more optimizational purposes.
For future sound updates that don't involve the client, platforms and sources are now inside the sounds.dat, not the actual game. This ensures that if a new platform needs to be added it can be added without having to update the entire game.
Adds more detailed information at startup to let you know what the game is doing, especially if it is loading things like doors, music, walls, etc.
The game will no longer show update dialogs when your connection is faulty, but will instead show error dialogs.
0.9.2
Now when creating an account you will be asked for your e-mail, this will later be used for password recovery. For people who already have an account before 0.9.2, please use the /changemail command.
0.9.1
Sounds.dat no longer comes pre-included with the client, this allows for faster downloads.
0.9
Last sub version of 0.
To prevent accidental muting of a buffer, you are now required to hold down the Control key when pressing M.
Adds online and offline sounds.
Adds some more realism to bikes, described below. 
You can no longer use transportation while going through doors or falling.
Now when you fall you hear the bike landing, not your character, and if your bike falls too far it will break. 
Also you can no longer bike off of a platform, so trying to bike 5 tiles, for example, with a blank tile on the 5th tile, will crash your bike. However if the bike detectsa platform that is 10 tiles or less below you, it will fall onto the platform. For example if there was a platform at -11, the bike wouldn't fall there, it'd crash. But if there was a platform at -10, the bike would detect it and you'd fall down onto it.
Lots of new sources.
Removes wood13, it was just strange and sounded similar to wood5.
Adds both the regular updater and sound updater.
0.8.4
Adds cement4.
Adds some extra sources.
Fixed some tiles that weren't showing up in the builder menu. They had been implemented, but they hadn't been shown.
Adds channels, hit F9.
Patches a runtime with creating a new account.
Two new water dispenser sources, thanks Brooke.
Checkpoints should now appear in the builder menu.
Adds ambiences, they should appear in the builder menu as well.
0.8.3
You can now hold down U for transportation. I personally did not like the idea, but I guess some people are lazy. LOL.
Now when choosing doors you will only be shown sounds categorized to that area. For example, selecting a move sound would only present you with door moving sounds, or selecting a close sound would only present you with door closing sounds.
I'd like to thank Marry, Hongjun, and Wong for doing a nice job in contributing at least 200 new doors into Golden Crayon!
You can now disallow the camera or coordinates in your map, use the builder menu, or use nocamera for the camera, and nocoords for the coordinates (in the rawdata).
0.8.2 patch 2
Another patch for 0.8.2, oops?
Well, the bike was playing step sounds when the user moved, so I had to fix that, ahem.
Fixed another bug with buffers saying emtpy (e m t p y) instead of empty (e m p t y).
0.8.2patch 1
This update brings some slight changes to the bike, like not being able to move in certain areas, and also prevents spamming the server with moving packets.
If you are past the boundaries of a map you will now automatically be moved to those boundaries.
Now if a buffer doesn't contain any content it will no longer be exported. This caused large files with a bunch of blank lines talking about exports that didn't even have any items.
Adds buffer muting, hit M. The only buffer that cannot be muted is alerts.
Adds the missing libs folder to the client, sorry about that.
0.8.2
This version introduces a more advanced version of the Bass Library wrapper, which allows volume control. Please use the F7 and F8 keys.
Fixes a funny bug with the canoe in which you'd hear the player walking while also paddling.
This version tries to add a bike, please let me know if it works. Use the U key as well.
0.8.1
This is an experimental feature, but I've heard sometimes people like adding some realism to their maps, for example, when boating across the lake, an ocean, etc. So this version adds a canoe. For any mode of transportation in the future, the key to control the movement is U.
Tries to fix beacons not updating when someone switches maps.
0.8
Adds an inventory, use Tab and Shift Tab.
Now for future website issues, when the website goes down, the net address will try to be identified internally from the client. This prevents incidents in which the website goes down and games are unplayable.
Pressing V in a menu no longer speaks music volume, due to the fact that some items are labeled with the letter V and pressing V would not speak that item, but would instead speak the volume.
Adds blockages. These are walls, or forcefields, that speak text when you run into them. For example, you could use it to block off an unfinished area, an impassible path, etc.
Fixes incorrect travelpoint parameters.
There is now an option in game settings to use more spaced out 3D audio. This basically widens the panning of the sounds. For some it may not be as noticeable, but it's more noticeable if your headphones have surround sound.
Lots of new sources.
There is another option in settings to allow bumping into a wall more than once. This affects both the camera and yourself as the player.
This is because I saw someone fall for miles below 0 and I mean, miles... like, -80000? And this was on the main map! Anyways, so now if you are building in the negatives you can no longer go below -1000. This prevents people from falling to crazy cordinates like that.
Changes some existing tile sounds to different ones, some of them were pretty interesting and didn't sound like what they were intended to be. Also tries to do a lot of trimming especially to some of the marbles and gravel.
0.7.31
This update patches a major bug with automatic doors.
0.7.3
Adds automatic doors. Keep in mind if you are using passworded doors this may severely break them. You must move the password parameter up one line and replace it with the new value, 1 or 0.
Here is an example. door start_x, start_y, start_z, end_x, end_y, end_z, speed, loop_sound, move_sound, open_sound, close_sound, automatic(a value between 0 and 1, 0 being manual and 1 being automatic), and then the password.
Fixed a bug with doors that would not make them fully duplicate when choosing to add a door on the opposite side. For example, if you had a passworded door on one side, it wouldn't make a passworded door on the other.
Fixed another bug with doors in which you would not move server side until you were fully through the door. So it'd look like you were stuck at the starting position.
Adds checkpoints.
0.7.2
Fixes F4 not working, it was interfering with the Alt modifier.
Attempts to add negative building support. If people end up falling through the floor, or errors show up, I might re-add negative protection again (means prevents you from falling below 0).
Adds 20 new music tracks.
Now if you are falling, every 25 tiles your falling speed will increase by 5. This is useful for longer falls and it also adds some more realism.
Ads game master volume. Keep in mind this doesn't control Audio URL volume, since BGT and the library powering this feature are separate.
0.7.1
Implements the use of streaming Audio URL's on your maps. This is experimental. Not all URL's will work. I've done some testing and so far it works with regular radio streams (like IceCast), Dropbox links, etc.
To insert a URL into your map use the following. url url_name, where url_name represents the URL you are trying to play. For example, url https://www.url.com
Keep in mind due to the time it takes to load a URL, the map will take some time to load if you use one or more URL's.
You can now adjust music volume by holding down Home and End, you don't have to tapp it anymore.
Fixed player beacons not saving.
0.7
Now if you are exitting a zone into an unknown area, you will be told the zone you were exitting before you reached that uncharted section.
If the server reboots / receives an update, you will now automatically reconnect.
Adds death messages. These are still in development, but you can place up to one message in separate areas. My plans are to allow random messages in one single area, but for now you guys can test this and see what you think, and if you like it I can start working on expanding them further.
Adds player beacons, use F6.
You can no longer jump when you are on a lift.
You can now press Control S to suicide.
Adds hazards.
Lifts will now wait 10 seconds when they reach the top or bottom of a shaft.
Fixed a bug in which you would be suspended in the air after the map was modified and you were on a lift.
Adds Alt F4 to force quit the game.
0.6.4
Adds lifts. These things go up and down over and over, and you can step onto them to be transported up and down. Please let me know if you find bugs with them.
Fixes a bug with buffers that would allow you to copy the empty buffer item to the clipboard.
Adds lots of new ambiences and a couple of new surfaces.
Adds two new music tracks.
0.6.3
Adds lots of new platforms, please thank Marry for her contributions, she deserves it.
Now you can access the builder menu, regardless of whether you are a contributor or not. However you will not be able to edit the map.
Adds a new menu in the builder, called Gallery, which allows you to view platforms, walls, sources, doors, and music in the game, without having to build them.
0.6.2
Now if you are moving through a door, and someone updates the map, you will be moved back to the starting cordinates of the door to avoid being stuck. For example, if you had a door at 50, 50, 0, and it started moving you, the map will be updated and you will be respawned at 50, 50, 0.
Tries to fix the issue with being able to move faster with the Left arrow.
Removes health drainers from the client, they will be back on the server soon hopefully.
Adds a few missing sounds.
Replaces virtualizer with my own text input class.
Game changes (0.6.1):
You can now hold down the Comma and Period keys to speedily move through a buffer, thanks Conner and Jonathan.
You can now only open one instance of the game, thanks Jonathan.
Fixed a bug in which the sign sounds would play when you are in an input field or when the map has been modified, regardless of the sign sounds setting.
Wax Template Builder changes (0.2):
One new template, box. This template allows you to construct rectangular or square surfaces with outer walls and a ceiling. This is perfect for bedrooms and other things.
Adds the template sound to the menu, it was absent in the first version.

0.6
This update introduces the Wax Template Builder, which allows you to build complex objects with premade templates, which take simple parameters and create what you want with minimal effort. This is the first version of the template builder, so there may be bugs. If you find any just let me know.
If you have a map that you would like to add to the game, you can now place it in the maps folder and press Control U inside the game to upload it.
0.5.2
This update contains a few bug fixes.
First, fixes health drainers not being destroyed when the map was updated / reloaded.
Second, fixes being able to sit or stand in the air, you should no longer be able to do this at all.
0.5.1
Adds a player menu, please hit F5.
Adds health control on maps. Health drainers will continue to drain a person's health over time in a certain area with a certain amount, and the map can also be given a default starting health value. To add the default value to a map use health value, for example, health 10000.
Adds plenty of new surfaces.
Changes map-activated elements from Shift Enter to just Enter.
Data now saves to appdata.
Trims some tile sounds.
You should no longer be able to jump past or move your camera past the max z of a map.
0.5
Changes the way the client loads and displays walls, doors, and music. Now they are pulled directly from the pack file and inserted into the strings. This makes it easier for me to add more walls, music and doors, without the need of having to insert them into the string myself. Keep in mind this doesn't work for platforms, it only works for the others because they are single files, not like platforms which have 7 files in total (5 step sounds, 1 land sound, and 1 fall sound).
Reduces the spamming door time to 1 second, hopefully his really helps.
Adds lots of new wall sounds.
Adds lots of new surfaces.
Changes the way doors are labeled. For people who used doors you will need to relabel your doors, because now each door has an open and close sound. For example, door5 would be door5open.ogg, and door5close.ogg.
Text is now copied to the clipboard for large data, such as getting the data of a map.
0.4.2
In case of server issues in the future, the game will now retrieve the address to connect to directly from my website, and not from the internal game.
0.4.1
This update introduces a couple new features.
First, typing /dlmaps will now download all maps that you are a contributor of to your computer. They will be stored in a sub-directory called "maps".
Second, adds sitting and standing, use the R key. Keep in mind if you fall you will need to get up again.
Third, adds a couple new platforms, bare, balloon, bathtubs 1 through 3.
0.4
Adds running, this is the original walking speed. I've slowed down the walking speed to suit this change. Use the Control key to control how you move.
Adds some new surfaces and a new wall.
Fixes a bug in which the word canceled would be spoken twice when hitting Escape out of an input field.
Now walls can be easily navigated in the builder menu by pressing their corresponding letter. For example, "o" for wallobject, "b" for wallbank.
Fixes beeps not playing when you jump to the top or bottom of a buffer, thanks Mohamed.
For Bootcamp users who don't have the ability to use Page Up and Down, you can now use Alt Up and Down to activate them respectively.
Attempts to fix doubled footsteps for players.
You can now add custom text to travelpoints. For example, you travel into etc etc. Just add an extra parameter to the travelpoint.
Adds clocks and calendars.
Adds first letter navigation, wrapping, and side scrolling support to menus, thanks Conner and Keri.
0.3.1
Adds passworded doors.
Adds buffer interrupting and buffer sounds.
Fixes bug with the music volume not saving, stupid me. LOL
Adds map chat.
0.3
Adds a camera (G with arrows, Page Up/Down, D, or Z).
Adds the ability to toggle sign sounds, use F4.

0.2
Fixed a bunch of bugs, doors not working, builder menu anouncements, zones, etc.
Adds Control N for creating new maps.
